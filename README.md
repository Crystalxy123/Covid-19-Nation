# Covid-19-Nation
This is the data for the National Epidemic Risk Analysis Model (NERAM).
We built a system to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 from four dimensions, National Epidemic Prevention & Control, Social Resilience, Epidemic Management, and Range of transmission. 

Four dimensions and their respective indicators are presented in the Table 1. Each dimension consists of several indicators, and there are total 15 indicators.The data is access from the Internet, government report and the research done by Deep Knowledge Group. And actually the 1,2 or 3 in the table means the value of the indicatorâ€™s state.
